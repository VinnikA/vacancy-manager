## FAQ

#### Who can benefit from this application?

It is very difficult for young professionals to keep track of their submitted vacancies - from which resource the vacancy was, what company name, what were their requirements, what was the salary offer and what did you write in the cover letter.
All this information will be contained in a web application that will allow you to fill your job database with your comments, ratings and deadlines and keep it all at hand.

#### Is there a fee to use the web application?

We consider helping beginners to be our social mission, because we ourselves were once beginners. Therefore, it is absolutely free to use.
